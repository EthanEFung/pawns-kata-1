# Pawns

## About this Repository
This is repository is a personal project meant to develop and review the following
* Creating a client-side using only HTML, CSS, and Javascript
* Creating a small server in Node.js, only using Express, and Jest
* Reviewing the DOM API, without using jQuery or MVC frameworks

## Why this might be useful to you
Secondarily this app-let has the meta goal of teaching the fundamentals of chess
pawn promotion in a controlled environment. 

### Minimally the end-user should:
* be able to view a 5 by 5 board with black and white pawns
* have game logic that toggles turns
* be able to move the white pieces up the board
* only be able to move the white pieces on his turn
* play an AI opponent

### Desired features: The end-user should:
* not be able to beat an AI opponent playing black pieces
* should have analysis of errors that were made
* should be notified of the users errors and view why 

## Retrospective

Was able to render a board with pieces on them, but spent most of my time creating
tests, which I haven't been able to make routine just yet.  Will try a second
iteration to speed the process.  Overall, very satisfied with how quickly I can 
boot up a server that feeds static files quickly.
